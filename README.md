# RIOT API Project

This project aims to build a tool that users can run on their own computers to interface with Riot's League of Legends API. Hopefully we can include some features that users would find meaningful and might not find on one of the many websites out there.

# Language Specification

Listing languages and version dependencies for development

## Rust
- Recommend using `rustup`
- Version 1.43.0

## Legacy Build

This was originally built as something completely different using React and whatever else I was interested in way back when. This code can still be found in the legacy branch, albeit with security vulnerabilities and no guarantee that anything works.
