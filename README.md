# RIOT API Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WestCoastPotato/Riot-API-Data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WestCoastPotato/Riot-API-Data)

## Description
This project aims to find some use for the Riot API that we can't find elsewhere on the web

## Current Topics to Explore
- Looking at improvement over the course of all Ranked Games
- Look at information from every Ranked Game Played

## Constraints (?)
Theoretically there won't be a lot of people using this so we shouldn't worry too much about space and computing costs
