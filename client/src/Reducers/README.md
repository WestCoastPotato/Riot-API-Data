# Reducers
Each of these should technically only do one thing. So make each reducer
take in the state and then export the state based on what command is entered

In theory we could just make this one application but that would not be as
separated as we would like. As such, it might be better to split reducer functionality
between separate reducers so that there is more organization between parts.
